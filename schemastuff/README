Schema test playground
----------------------

To make it easier to keep the web API and the TypeScript client in sync,
we want to use a common schema for requests/responses/messages, used both in Python
and in TypeScript/JavaScript. One way would be:

[marshmallow] -(1)-> [json schema] -(2)-> [typescript]

1) can be done with marshmallow-jsonschema, 2) with json-schema-to-typescript

Sadly, it doesn't currently work yet, because of an issue related to

https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript/issues/132

As I understand, the output of marshmallow-jsonschema is not to spec with JSON schema,
"a JSON Reference object is only allowed to have a $ref property (any other property
are ignored, per the spec)."

The spec says: "Any members other than "$ref" in a JSON Reference object SHALL be ignored."
